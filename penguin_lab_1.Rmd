```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

1. Load packages and read-in penguins.csv data

```{r}

library(tidyverse)
library(car)
library(onewaytests)

penguins <- read_csv("penguins.csv")

```

Is there a significant difference in mean flipper length for female penguins by species (Chinstrap, Gentoo, and Adelie)?

2. Do some exploring

New functions: with + table for easy counting over multiple factors

Update species name using case_when

```{r}

counts <- with(penguins, table(species, sex))

```
